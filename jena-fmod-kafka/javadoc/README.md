# Kafka Connector Module for Apache Jena Fuseki

This artifact is purely a convenience uber-JAR for dropping the Kafka Connector Module for Apache Jena Fuseki into your
Fuseki deployment via a single JAR file.  Thus, there is no code/Javadoc present in this module itself.

Please refer to Javadoc on the `jena-kafka-client`, `jena-kafka-connector`, and `jena-fuseki-kafka-module` artifacts 
as needed.
